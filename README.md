# iqutext
Scripts for flex-to-latex processing of Iquito texts.

Run the `interlinearized.py` script to generate LaTeX output for FLEx XML input files.

`interlinearized.py` was written by Greg Finley for Matsigenka texts and has been lightly edited to make it compatible with Python 3 and for use with Iquito texts. For Greg's original instructions see the file `readme.txt`.

The `environment.yml` file can be used to create an Anaconda Python environment suitable for executing `interlinearized.py`.
